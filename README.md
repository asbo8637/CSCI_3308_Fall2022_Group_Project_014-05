### Vision Statement
To create an open platform where Boulder students can share their very valuable opinions on everything in the universe except each other.

### Application Description
RottenBuffs is an application specifically designed to rate anything, but people. Rate pets, famous things(not people), concepts(eg the impending doom of us all), and even food. Login with your buff email to completely trash or love things. The RottenBuffs app will provide functionality to leave ratings and reviews for things. Users will also be able to report any reviews or posts that they believe to be inappropriate for the platform(ex: people). A review is one good or bad rating, as well as an optional description/comment.
The website will include functionality to search for specific categories or things to leave reviews for as well as a trending page which will display things that are currently popular on the platform. There will be a my reviews page where the user’s own past reviews will be shown.
